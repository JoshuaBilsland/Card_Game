# Card_Game
A two player card game NEA project that I had to make as part of Computer Science GCSE.

## Extra Information
A game where two players, using the same computer, pick a card from the top of a shuffles deck and based on the colour of the card and/or number on the card a winner is decided based on the rules of the game(read the pdf in the Card_Game_Files directory for more information).






(*I STARTED THIS PROGRAM BEFORE I STARTED USING GITHUB SO SOME PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE ALREADY*)
